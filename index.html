            <p>NIST has always been grabbing opportunities where academia and industry come together in a win-win
                situation. It has been making consistent efforts to collaborate with renowned academic institutions and
                industries to provide world class exposure to the students. It emphasizes on the collaborative research
                funded by the Government and Industry funding agencies. The institute has built up strong industrial
                interaction with various industries for collaboration in research work. These eminent collaborations
                help the students acquire the knowledge, skills and aptitude required in our times for participation on
                a global level in terms of higher studies, placements, and entrepreneurship. These sponsored research
                programs have helped the institute create the infrastructure and strengthen the facilities in some of
                the emerging areas of technology. The Institute has also received numerous research grants, projects,
                special funding, travel funding, SDPs, FIST grant and scholarships from the DST, CSIR, AICTE and
